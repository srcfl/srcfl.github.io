Setting up a Solana wallet is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps:

1. **Choose a wallet provider:** There are several wallet providers that support Solana, including Phantom (preferred) and Solflare. Available as an app for iPhone and Android, plus browser extensions for popular browsers like Chrome. Then follow their instructions for creating a new wallet.

2. **Create a new wallet:** Once you've chosen a wallet provider, follow the instructions to create a new wallet. You'll be asked to choose a secure password and seed phrase, which you have to save and keep in a safe place. **Sourceful will never ask you for your seed phrase or password!**

3. **Link your wallet to Sourceful:** During the Energy Gateway setup process in the app, you'll be prompted to link your Solana wallet. Look for the wallet icon at the beginning of the onboarding process.
