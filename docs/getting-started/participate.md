## Get a Sourceful Energy Gateway

By getting a Sourceful Energy Gateway, you can start validating green energy from your Distributed Energy Resource (DER) and earning tokens for contributing to the decentralized energy grid. To get started, visit our [Store](https://sourceful.energy/store) 

### Requirements

To install a Sourceful Energy Gateway, there are several requirements that must be met to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with the Sourceful network.

Firstly, the **Modbus TCP protocol must be activated** on the inverter. This is necessary to enable the communication between the inverter and the Energy Gateway, which allows for the measurement and validation of the energy produced by the DER.

It is also important to have access to **Wi-Fi and power delivery near** the DER to ensure that the Energy Gateway can function properly and connect to the Sourceful network. This will ensure that the data collected from the DER is accurate and that the validation process is reliable.

## Support the Sourceful Community
