# Sourceful Documentation

## Participate in shaping the future of energy with Sourceful

### What is Sourceful? 

Sourceful is an innovative energy network designed to accelerate and cordinate the expansion of renewable energy sources. Our mission is to build the world's largest decentralized virtual power plant (VPP) by connecting Distributed Energy Resources (sush as solar plants and battery storage).

**Our mission: Accelerate solar power and stabilize the energy grid.**

### How does it work?
By connecting your solar inverter, battery or energy meter to our Energy Gateway, you'll be rewarded with ENERGY tokens. In the future, you'll also be rewarded for allowing control of your solar plant or battery to participate in grid stabilization and other smart energy services.

We're currently in a beta phase, offering early adopters a unique opportunity to shape the future of decentralized energy. Beta participants will be rewarded as a recognition of their early involvement and contributions during the beta phase. 

Join us in exploring the exciting possibilities of a smart, decentralized energy grid with Sourceful.
